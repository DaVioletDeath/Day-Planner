# Day-Planner by Violet Dreyfuss

    # local storage functionality so it retains the information even when the page is refreshed
    # accurately says the date and reflects whether a time variable is past present or future, changed my computer's time manually to make sure
    # Sizable save button for accessibility
    # prompt to add event there so the user knows where to click, rather than a big box of nothing
